Here’s a clear description of what your SpaceWatch app **should display when different buttons are clicked** (assuming a typical feature set based on your requirements):

### **1. Layer Selection Buttons**
**What happens:**  
- When a user clicks a specific layer button (e.g., “True Color,” “NDVI,” “Color Infrared”), the map updates to display satellite imagery using that visualization.
- The legend and description for the selected layer are shown (e.g., “NDVI highlights vegetation health in green tones”).
- Any previously displayed overlays or legends update to match the new layer.

### **2. Date Picker / Time Range Selector**
**What happens:**  
- When a user selects a date or date range, the map reloads to show satellite imagery from that time period.
- If the selected date has no available imagery, the app displays a message: “No imagery available for this date. Please select another date.”
- Optionally, a time-lapse or comparison slider appears if a range is chosen.

### **3. Location Search Button**
**What happens:**  
- When a user enters a place name or coordinates and clicks “Search,” the map pans and zooms to the specified location.
- The app fetches and displays the latest satellite imagery and weather data for that area.
- A marker or highlight appears on the searched location.

### **4. Weather Overlay Toggle**
**What happens:**  
- When toggled on, a semi-transparent weather overlay appears on the map (showing temperature, precipitation, or cloud cover).
- When toggled off, the overlay disappears, and only the satellite imagery remains.
- The weather legend updates to explain the overlay’s colors or symbols.

### **5. Download Image Button**
**What happens:**  
- When clicked, the current map view (with the selected layer and overlays) is exported as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
- A download prompt appears, or the image is saved to the user’s device.

### **6. Info or Help Button**
**What happens:**  
- When clicked, a modal or sidebar opens with explanations of each layer, how to use the app, and data sources.
- May include tips for best results and troubleshooting steps.

### **7. Reset or Home Button**
**What happens:**  
- The map resets to the default view (e.g., global view, default layer, no overlays).
- All selections (date, location, overlays) return to their initial state.

**Each button should provide immediate visual feedback (such as highlighting, loading spinners, or updated legends) to confirm the action to the user.**  
This ensures the app is intuitive and responsive, supporting a smooth exploration of satellite and weather data.
